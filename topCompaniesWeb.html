            <p><span class="strt"> Microsoft ($2,211 Billion)</span> Microsoft is the second-largest tech company, due to its market capitalization of more than $2 trillion. It is also one of the most expensive companies and brands worldwide.

                The internationally famous corporation was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. They suggested using packaged software for home computers to make PC experience easy, user-friendly, and intuitive. And so, the Windows operating system was born. It brought Microsoft an incredible success and huge profits.
                
                Since that time, the company has diversified its services and expanded its markets. Today, Microsoft offers operating systems for computers, servers, phones, intelligent gadgets, as well as productivity applications, business solution apps, management and development tools, games, and many more.
                
                Also, recently, Microsoft has slightly changed their field of interest. The company is now focusing on innovative technologies, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, trying to become a leader in the field.</p>

            <p><span class="strt"> Alphabet ($1874 Billion)</span> Probably, almost all Internet users have heard about Google at least once. But some may not know that in 2015 the internationally famous Internet giant changed its official name to Alphabet Inc. At that time, the company was already out of the scope of the Google search engine. Today, more than thirty popular services and sub-companies are part of the Alphabet Holding. Besides, the conglomerate owns a lot of interesting side projects, such as life-extension company Calico or smart home project Nest. Not to mention the Android OS. Also, Alphabet owns the Google Venture division, which invests in start-ups, as well as Google Capital for long-term projects. It's not a surprise, that Alphabet is one of the most trusted major tech companies worldwide. The conglomerate was established in 1993 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page. The headquarter is in Mountain View, California, USA</p>

            <p><span class="strt"> Amazon ($ 1694 Billion)</span> Amazon takes the fourth place on our rating by market value. It has the highest employee number in the tech sector as well.

                Besides, Amazon is one of the companies with the most expensive stocks. The price of one Amazon share is more than $3,000.
                
                Some may say that Amazon is more of a retail seller than a tech company. Fair enough. Still, it has a computing division that brings about 15% of revenue annually. And let's not forget that the main product of the company is the online shopping service.
                
                Also, you have probably heard about the cloud computing platform called Amazon Web Service. It helps start-ups, enterprises, government, and academic institutions to create any type of business online by providing them with compute, storage, database, and other tech services.
                
                Besides, there are thousands of Alexa devices, which have already found their homes.
                
                The company was established in 1994 by Jeff Bezos and is headquartered in Seattle, Washington.</p>

            <p><span class="strt"> Facebook ($ 982 Billion)</span> Facebook is one of the fastest-growing businesses and one of the most expensive brands worldwide. Indeed, the market value of $982 billion is an astronomical indicator of popularity for an Internet project.

                Facebook was developed by Mark Zuckerberg in February 2004.
                
                The social network is currently visited by more than 2 billion people every day, which might be the limit in their global growth, as some people say. So, in recent years, the company focused on another way to grow, specifically on acquisitions.
                
                Today, Facebook Inc. owns a lot of other popular projects, among which are Instagram, Messenger, Whatsapp, and Oculus VR.
                
                Facebook is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, USA. </p>
